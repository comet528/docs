# Incident Response Procedures

## Incident Response Framework

### Incident Definition
An incident is any event that causes or may cause:
- Service disruption or degradation
- Security compromise or breach
- Data loss or corruption
- Customer impact or business disruption

### Response Objectives
1. **Minimize Impact**: Reduce customer and business impact
2. **Restore Service**: Return to normal operations quickly
3. **Preserve Evidence**: Maintain forensic evidence for analysis
4. **Communicate**: Keep stakeholders informed
5. **Learn**: Conduct post-incident reviews for improvement

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0) - Immediate Response
- **Definition**: Complete service outage, security breach, or data loss
- **Examples**:
  - Customer API completely unavailable
  - Database compromise or data breach
  - Certificate authority compromise
  - Partner integration complete failure
- **Response Time**: 15 minutes
- **Escalation**: Immediate executive notification

#### High (P1) - Urgent Response  
- **Definition**: Major functionality impacted, significant customer impact
- **Examples**:
  - Partial service outage (>25% customers affected)
  - Certificate expiry causing authentication failures
  - Database performance severely degraded
  - Critical certificate near expiry (<24 hours)
- **Response Time**: 30 minutes
- **Escalation**: Management notification within 1 hour

#### Medium (P2) - Standard Response
- **Definition**: Minor functionality issues, limited customer impact
- **Examples**:
  - Individual service performance degradation
  - Non-critical certificate warnings
  - Backup job failures
  - Partner integration intermittent issues  
- **Response Time**: 2 hours
- **Escalation**: Team lead notification

#### Low (P3) - Scheduled Response
- **Definition**: Enhancement requests, documentation issues
- **Examples**:
  - Feature requests
  - Documentation updates
  - Non-urgent configuration changes
- **Response Time**: Next business day
- **Escalation**: Normal team processes

## Incident Response Team Structure

### Core Response Team
- **Incident Commander**: Overall incident coordination
- **Technical Lead**: Technical investigation and resolution
- **Communications Lead**: Stakeholder communication
- **Security Lead**: Security-related incidents (when applicable)

### Extended Team (as needed)
- **Database Administrator**: MongoDB Atlas issues
- **Network Engineer**: Connectivity and firewall issues
- **Certificate Manager**: PKI and certificate issues
- **Vendor Liaisons**: Azure/Microsoft support coordination

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### Automated Detection
- **Monitoring Alerts**: Prometheus/Grafana alerts
- **Health Checks**: Service health endpoint failures  
- **Certificate Monitoring**: Automated certificate expiry alerts
- **Security Events**: Authentication failure spikes, certificate validation errors

#### Manual Detection
- **Customer Reports**: Support ticket escalation
- **Partner Notifications**: Partner system alerts
- **Internal Discovery**: Team member identification

#### Initial Response Steps
1. **Acknowledge Alert**: Confirm incident detection
2. **Assess Severity**: Determine initial severity level
3. **Form Response Team**: Assemble appropriate responders
4. **Create Incident Record**: Document incident in tracking system
5. **Begin Investigation**: Start initial diagnostic steps

### Phase 2: Investigation and Diagnosis (15-60 minutes)

#### System Health Assessment
```bash
# Quick system health check
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -v Running
kubectl get nodes | grep -v Ready  
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces | sort -k3 -nr | head -20
```

#### Certificate Health Check
```bash
# Check certificate expiry across system
kubectl get certificates --all-namespaces
openssl s_client -connect <customer-api>:443 -servername <hostname>
curl -v --cert client.crt --key client.key https://<partner-endpoint>
```

#### Database Connectivity
```bash
# Test MongoDB connection
mongosh "mongodb+srv://<cluster>/test" --username <user> --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
# Check connection pool status
kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod> | grep -i mongo | tail -50
```

#### Network Diagnostics
```bash
# Test external connectivity
curl -I https://<partner-endpoint>
nslookup <mongodb-cluster>
traceroute <external-service>

# Check Istio service mesh
istioctl proxy-status
istioctl proxy-config cluster <pod> | grep <service>
```

### Phase 3: Containment and Mitigation (Variable Duration)

#### Service Recovery Actions
1. **Pod Restart**: Restart failing pods
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
   ```

2. **Certificate Renewal**: Emergency certificate renewal
   ```bash
   # Trigger certificate renewal job
   kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<cert-renewal-job> manual-renewal-$(date +%s)
   ```

3. **Traffic Rerouting**: Redirect traffic away from failing components
   ```bash
   # Update Istio destination rules
   kubectl apply -f emergency-routing.yaml
   ```

4. **Database Failover**: Switch to backup database if needed
   ```bash
   # Update connection strings to backup cluster
   kubectl patch configmap app-config --patch '{"data":{"DB_URL":"mongodb+srv://backup-cluster"}}'
   ```

### Phase 4: Resolution and Recovery

#### Service Restoration
- **Gradual Restoration**: Slowly restore traffic to repaired services
- **Health Verification**: Confirm all health checks pass
- **Performance Validation**: Verify response times within SLA
- **Customer Validation**: Confirm customer-facing functionality

#### Monitoring Enhancement
- **Increased Monitoring**: Temporary enhanced monitoring during recovery
- **Alert Tuning**: Adjust alert thresholds if needed
- **Performance Baselines**: Update baselines based on incident learnings
