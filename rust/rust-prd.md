I would like to learn the Rust language.
I know Golang intermediate level, I know java, javascript, typescript, and a bit of python.

I enjoy a lot of system level programming in go, I don't really do much application stuff - mainly tools and utilitis, someimes with web frontends, sometimes with rest apis, often utility clis speaking to multiple backends.

Create me around a 5 week course to quickly master the basics of rust, how to create a hello world, how to deploy  and run and distribute it. How to create distroless rust containers etc etc

The goal is 2 fold - to understand how rust contrasts with golang.
Secondly to be able to build cli based and web based (rest api - no htmi ui) utilities.
