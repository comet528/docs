When this docs directory is "mounted" in visual studio - the intention is to discuss and capture design decisions and approaches inside the docs folder and nowhere else unless explcitly directed. 

An extended prompt will likely be referenced and the answer to that prompt under a subdirectory under docs needs to be added to the prompt file.

So this docs structure is a appendage to capture conversation, designs and approaches around the other projects attached to  vsc project.
