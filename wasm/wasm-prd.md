# Objective

I need you to create me a training course for Web Assembly related to Envoy proxy and istio.
I need to know what it is, what it does, and how to make it do useful things.
I also need a compehensive list of the types of things it has been used to do - so I can likely cherry pick examples that match my usecases.
I program in golang so that likely helps in giving me instructions on how to create and load plugins. I'm happy to learn rust if it makes the journy simpler
as the object is to be able to build production quality plugins.
I likely need a course that will take at most a day to complete.
I've very competant and capabiilty, deep network, k8s, infra, golang experience
 
Answer: see `wasm/wasm-training.md` for a complete one‑day course with hands‑on labs (Rust‑first with a complete TinyGo appendix), Envoy local runs, and Istio `WasmPlugin` deployment.
