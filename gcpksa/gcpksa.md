# GCP KSA Notes

Things that Need dealing with.

- mount points - nullify for now
- image startup
- image startup script
- db connection
- maybe swap to a ocitest image


## Notes about startup script
Single Image check some env vars the calls
```
/usr/o3/monrepo2/scripts/singleImageEntrypoint.sh (or similar)
```

Mounting looks a bit messed up 
HPA is messed up

## Next Steps
