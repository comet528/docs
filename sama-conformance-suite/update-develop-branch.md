Got it. You want “develop” to point at the current release and stop fighting an ancient branch. Here’s the clean, low-risk way to do it while preserving history.

### 0) Decide the commit you want as the new base

Use a tag or branch tip for the current release:

```bash
# examples
TARGET=<release-tag-or-branch>        # e.g. v2.7.3 or release/2025-10
# or a specific commit
# TARGET=abc1234
```

### 1) Save where the old `develop` was (belt-and-braces)

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git checkout develop
git tag backup/develop-$(date +%Y%m%d)              # tag old tip for reference
git push origin backup/develop-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### 2) Rename the old `develop` (keep it around)

```bash
git branch -m develop develop-legacy
git push origin develop-legacy
git push origin :develop                             # delete remote develop
```

If branch protection blocks deletion, temporarily relax it in repo settings, then repeat the delete.

### 3) Create a fresh `develop` from the release tip

```bash
git checkout -b develop $TARGET
git push -u origin develop
```

That’s it. `origin/develop` now tracks the release snapshot.

---

## Alternative (faster, more disruptive): move develop in place

If you don’t care to keep `develop-legacy` visible:

```bash
git fetch --all
git branch -f develop $TARGET
git push --force-with-lease origin develop
```

This force-moves the remote pointer. Anyone with local `develop` must hard-reset (see “Team fallout” below).

---

## Team fallout you should handle (do these right after)

* **Default branch**: If `develop` is the default, it stays default—but now points to the new base. If default was something else, verify it in GitHub → *Settings → Branches*.
* **Branch protection**: Re-enable protections on `develop` (and add new rule for `develop-legacy` if you want it frozen).
* **Open PRs targeting `develop`**: Rebase or retarget as appropriate.
* **Pipelines**: If CI keys off branch names, confirm jobs still trigger.

### Message for collaborators (copy/paste)

For the rename workflow:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
# if they had 'develop' checked out:
git checkout develop || git checkout -b develop origin/develop
git reset --hard origin/develop

# optional: keep the old head locally too
git checkout -b develop-legacy origin/develop-legacy
```

For the force-move workflow:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git checkout develop
git reset --hard origin/develop
```

---

## Quick sanity checks

```bash
git log --oneline -n 3 develop
git branch -a | grep develop
git ls-remote --heads origin | grep develop
```

---

## Why this is safer than merging a fossilized branch

* No noisy merges or meaningless conflict resolution.
* Old work is preserved (tag + `develop-legacy`), auditable, and can be cherry-picked intentionally.
* CI/PR hygiene stays clean since `develop` now represents current reality.

If you tell me the release tag/branch you want to pin to, I’ll hand you the commands with the placeholders filled and the exact order tailored to your protections.
